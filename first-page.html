        <h2>Messi</h2>
        <p>Messi was born in Argentina in 1987, making him 34 years old. He stands at 5'7" earning him the
            nickname 'La Pulga' or 'The Flea.' Messi made a name for himself and was scouted by Barcelona at
            a very young age. He ended up joining the club at 13 years old signing his first contract on a
            napkin. Messi spent the majority of his career at Barcelona only recently making a move to PSG,
            a club in the French league. </p>

    <div class="p2">
        <h2>Ronaldo</h2>
        <p>Ronaldo was born in Portugal in 1085, making him 36 years old, two years older than Messi. He stands
            at 6'2" making him a dominating force in the air. Ronaldo began his career in the Portuguese leage,
            playing for Sporting Lisbon, until earning himself a move to Manchester United in 2003. After six years
            at the English club, he earned another move to Real Madrid, Barcelonas rivals. It was in Spain that
            Ronaldo would cement his legacy in futbols history books.

        <h2>Messi vs Ronaldo</h2>
        <p>Messi vs Ronaldo, David vs Goliath, this comparison began when Ronaldo started his new chapter in Real
            Madrid. Since both Messi and Ronaldo moved on from Spain the conversation has died down as Ronaldo is
            past his prime. Messi on the other hand is still producing, and is heavily favored to win his sixth
            Ballon d'Or, or the award for the best player in the world. Ronaldo has five of these awards. In third
            place for most Ballon d'Ors are three players with three awards each. Making Messi and Ronaldo clear of
            everyone else. Besides awards both players have won every trophy there is to win, except for the World
            Cup. Both have one internationally, but never the most coveted international award. Many people like to
            compare stats when discussing these two players, goals and assists. Messi has more of both while Ronaldo
            had a two year headstart. There is also minutes per goal/assist, or how many minutes on average pass before
            a player records a goal or assist. Messi in 938 career apparances, contributes to a goal every 71.9 minutes.
            Ronaldo with 1,083 career apparances, contributes to a goal every 86.3 minutes. Both insane records, but
            Messi comes out on top. As of the time I am writing this Ronaldo only has 41 more goals than Messi, but Messi
            has 89 more asssist than Ronaldo.
        </p>
        <p>I do not like comparing players by stats. There is so much more involved in the game that is not shown by statistics.
            Just by watching a game you can see Messi is having much more of an impact. He creates scoring chances for himself
            and the rest of teamates. Ronaldo scores when his teamates create a chance for him. Ronaldo is the perfect striker,
            dangerous with both feet and with his head. Messi really only uses his left foot and is not winning headers over
            defenders that are six inches taller than him. These physical differences have made them into different players.
            Both are great, but there can only be one greatest of all time. For me Messi takes that crown.
